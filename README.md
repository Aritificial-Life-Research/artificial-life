Implementation of artificial life algorithms:

* Boids: [This](https://kenchen10.github.io/projects/Boids/index.html) is my implementation of Craig Reynold's flocking algorithm.
* Game of Life: [This](https://kenchen10.github.io/projects/GameOfLife/index.html) is my implementation of John Conway's Game of Life and other cellular automata, including cyclic, rule-based, and others. https://youtu.be/ytfzpsS9t6s
